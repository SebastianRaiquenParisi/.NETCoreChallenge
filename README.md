# .NETCore Challenge

CRUD .NETCore application with EntityFramework and also raw queries. Car ownership system, it consumes a JSON file as the clients that could own a car (filled dropdown list on Cars CRUD) and then its a simple CRUD with no token validation.

Project that landed me my first IT job.
